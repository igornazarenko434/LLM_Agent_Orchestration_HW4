i want you now to implemet mission 7.6. you need to act as a top data scientist with more than 30 years of experience in the project full stack developement includint epertise in agents building, agents orchestration in both roduction ready industry field and in th academy research. you are familiar with all the updated new best practises for NLP, agents and data science opics and know the best how to combine it all to working, efficient, cost awared full stack project. now understand what we wanted to build in mission 7.7, be aware and see how we implemented all the full fllow of the project untill this point and hot it is the best way to connect this agent to all the working system. than i want you to think of the best way to implement our judjment agent, based on the inputs he will get with the exact format from all of the worker agents (think if we wat him also to include the data each one of the worker agents got to search the content they fetched) so our judge agent will include the best practises of agents, will be smart enouth and he will include some smart scoring system so he could pick and choose the best solution content from the 3 agents for each step. make sure he is efficient, know how to deal with the queues and multithreading if he needs, keeps loging infrmation if we need it,and connected in the best way to all the other modules. make sure you also create a unit test for all of it's functionallities and validate all it's proccessing and test them.make sure you are ding and building it all according to uor PRD and arhitecture design and if you choose to apply some other method or best practise you need to remember to adjust and edit our PRD and arhitecture and change if we need the connected other missions that dependant on this one. check that this module works with the best practise by himself and also work as a whole module insed the whole system. i want you in the end save this full prompt insdie the prompt log folder as a cnotinues prompt in the agents_system_design_prompt file and after this write not in too long but efficient way what did you understand from this prompt, how you act and what you did according to this, especcia;y if you changed something in th eproject
