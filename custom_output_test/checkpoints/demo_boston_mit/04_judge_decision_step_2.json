        "description": "Charles River Esplanade Boston is a great place for walking or kayaking.  In this kayak tour video.  I paddle through the Charles River Esplanade, and return to Charles River Canoe and Kayak on the Cambridge side of the Charles River.  The video starts with a view of MIT and the Harvard Bridge then proceeds through the Charles River Esplanade.  I encounter wildlife such as swans and ducks and kayakers along the way.  There is a view of Boston and the Longfellow Bridge along the way.\n\nThe Charles River Esplanade is a popular recreational area located in Boston, Massachusetts. It stretches for 3 miles along the banks of the Charles River and is a favorite spot for walkers, runners, cyclists, and boaters. The Esplanade features paved walkways, playgrounds, athletic fields, and a number of public art installations. It is also home to the Hatch Memorial Shell, an outdoor amphitheater that hosts a variety of musical and cultural events throughout the year, including the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular on the Fourth of July.\n\nOriginally constructed in the early 20th century as part of the \"City Beautiful\" movement, the Charles River Esplanade has undergone a number of renovations over the years to improve accessibility and safety. Today, it is one of Boston's most beloved outdoor spaces, providing a peaceful oasis amidst the hustle and bustle of city life. Whether you're looking for a place to exercise, enjoy a picnic, or simply soak up some sun and scenery, the Charles River Esplanade is the perfect destination.\n\nThe kayak was rented from and returned to Charles River Canoe and Kayak.  Charles River Canoe and Kayak is located on Broad Canal in Kendall Square.  \n\nI hope you enjoyed the video!\nIf you like what you\u2019ve seen, please feel free to subscribe:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@HikeWalkPaddle?sub_confirmation=1\n\nIf you\u2019ve found my content useful, \u201cBuy Me a Coffee\u201d to support my hobby:\nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/HikeWalkPaddle\n\nPaddle Boston- Charles River Canoe and Kayak:\nhttps://paddleboston.com/rentals/our-locations/cambridge-at-kendall-square/\n\nKey Moments:\nView of Mass Ave. Bridge and Cambridge 0:00\nEnter Charles River Esplanade Pond0:16\nEsplanade Canals 1:11\nSwan 1:30\nFellow Kayakers 2:01\nExit Charles River Esplanade 3:44\nCormorant 4:17\nLongfellow Bridge 4:56\nEntrance to Broad Canal 5:32\nCharles River Canoe and Kayak 6:30\n\n\ud83d\udc40 Visit my website here: https://www.HikeWalkPaddle.com \ud83d\udc40\n\nHERE ARE MY PLAYLISTS \ud83c\udfa5:\n\nMassachusetts Walkthrough Tours\ud83d\udc5f: \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIOMblQAGj39aEv-mId0IaOsbFEcR4Lbe\n\nNew York State Walkthrough Tours\ud83d\udc5f: \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIOMblQAGj3-8Jc6SWYvmDdtcX0Jg3Oya\n\nMassachusetts Aerial Drone Videos\ud83d\ude81: \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIOMblQAGj3_plEVDVEtWjVZzHfhV-x5-\n\nFavorites\u2764:\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIOMblQAGj38y0kyrOHZ9c5Ya4mFW32_R",
