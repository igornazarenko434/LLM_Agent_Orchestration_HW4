I paddle through the Charles River Esplanade, and return to Charles River Canoe and Kayak on the Cambridge side of the Charles River.  The video starts with a view of MIT and the Harvard Bridge then proceeds through the Charles River Esplanade.  I encounter wildlife such as swans and ducks and kayakers along the way.  There is a view of Boston and the Longfellow Bridge along the way.\n\nThe Charles River Esplanade is a popular recreational area located in Boston, Massachusetts. It stretches for 3 miles along the banks of the Charles River and is a favorite spot for walkers, runners, cyclists, and boaters. The Esplanade features paved walkways, playgrounds, athletic fields, and a number of public art installations. It is also home to the Hatch Memorial Shell, an outdoor amphitheater that hosts a variety of musical and cultural events throughout the year, including the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular on the Fourth of July.\n\nOriginally constructed in the early 20th century as part of the \"City Beautiful\" movement, the Charles River Esplanade has undergone a number of renovations over the years to improve accessibility and safety. Today, it is one of Boston's most beloved outdoor spaces, providing a peaceful oasis amidst the hustle and bustle of city life. Whether you're looking for a place to exercise, enjoy a picnic, or simply soak up some sun and scenery, the Charles River Esplanade is the perfect destination.\n\nThe kayak was rented from and returned to Charles River Canoe and Kayak.

Ave.\" Bridge) is a steel haunched girder bridge  carrying Massachusetts Avenue (Route 2A) over the Charles River and connecting Back Bay, Boston with Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is the longest bridge over the Charles River at 2,164.8 feet (387.72 sm; 659.82 m).\nAfter years of disagreement between the cities of Boston and Cambridge, the bridge was built jointly by the two cities between 1887 and 1891. It was  named for Harvard University founder John Harvard. Originally equipped with a central swing span, it was revised several times over the years until its superstructure was completely replaced in the late 1980s due to unacceptable vibration and the collapse of a similar bridge in Connecticut.\nThe bridge is known locally for being marked off in the idiosyncratic unit of length called the smoot.\n\n",

Ave.\" Bridge) is a steel haunched girder bridge  carrying Massachusetts Avenue (Route 2A) over the Charles River and connecting Back Bay, Boston with Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is the longest bridge over the Charles River at 2,164.8 feet (387.72 sm; 659.82 m).\nAfter years of disagreement between the cities of Boston and Cambridge, the bridge was built jointly by the two cities between 1887",
